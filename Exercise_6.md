Exercise 6: String Manipulations + API's

Part 1: Finish (the inclass) Challenge 2 with your partner
	- use at least 4 methods of the Array or String class to manipulate + change text. Ideas include:
		- cleaning up the text (spaces, punctuation, white space, etc )
		- change words, substrings
	- visualize the output in someway. Ideas include:
		- counting the occurance of words + using that to control a visual
		- illustrate the text on the screen, by parsing it for values to show/control differently.

	You could take in text from the user and manipulate that. You could make a mad-libs. You could make the annoying text editor. Data visualization, etc.

Part 2: (for the following week)

Take a data set of some sort (text, API, JSON, XML) as an input. Your code should parse the input, looking for key/value pairs or some other rhythm inherent in the data (ex, spacing between words, commas, periods, etc).

The output should be evident in some way, whether this is visually through text, or some other way of visualizing the information.

This counts as 2 exercises.
