## Creative Coding: An Intro to Creative Coding
2 Metrotech Center Room 811
6:30pm - 9:20pm Monday


This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no programming experience, who are interested in creating interactivity.  Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result.  In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking - to think concurrently and modularly.  By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for creating interactivity including: event-driven creative applications, interactive installations,  graphical user interfaces, games and user interfaces.  Interactivity will be introduced and discussed throughout.

# Program Goals

This course reinforces the IDM Program Objectives by

Develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities in art and design.

Develop technical skills to realize their ideas.

Develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

Gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

Develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### Prerequisites

This course presumes no prior knowledge of programming. It does assume a high degree of computer literacy. We will learn about programming in a platform-generic way.

### Assessment

Assessment will occur by reviewing weekly coding assignments & challenges, project milestones, and final projects. The course is cumulative.  Please see the Grading Section for specific grade breakdown, calendar for due dates, and assignments for briefs. 

Students will evaluate their own progressed in a course in two ways: 1) A course evaluation form, which will be developed based on the course’s individual objectives. 2) Students will participate in a self reflection assignment due Week 7  & Week 15 or as otherwise noted. This written evaluation is worth 15 points and to be turned into me as a separate document.

• Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result. 

• Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.

Week 15 only: 
• Compare and contrast OOP versus Procedural Programming


### Course Requirements

• Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many, etc) ONLY

• Talk to me in person about issues or problems

• Consult the github account for the class at least once a week for up to date information 

• Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave

• Acquire and keep up with all of the readings. Read all assigned readings before class.

• Devote at a minimum 8 to 12 hours a week OUTSIDE of class, fulfilling homework assignments, readings and studying concepts covered in class, in order to do average.

• Have Patience, Persistence, and Discipline

• Be Creative

• Pay attention to Detail & Craft

• Have Self-confidence and Pride in your work

• Take Risks & be Fearless in your assignments

• Don’t be afraid to fail. Don’t let your failures determine you. Rise again.

### Attendance

Attendance is important to this course for multiple reasons. Quite a bit of material is covered in each class. In addition, class is seen as a community to support and to develop ideas and learning.

Missing more than 2 classes may result in a decreased letter grade. Three or more absences are grounds for dismissal from the course. Absences can have a deeply negative impact on your grade, especially if you are struggling. Please manage your time appropriately.

• All presentation and critique days are mandatory.  Being absent on critique days, affects your grade for that project as well as your participation grade. Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not. Critiques can not be made up.

• Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. ([Slack](https://gradcreativecodingb.slack.com) Direct message is preferred). Demonstrate time management, communication and respect.

• Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.

### Contacting Me
[Slack](https://gradcreativecodingb.slack.com) Direct Message is the preferred initial contact. Otherwise you may email me (katherine.bennett@nyu.edu). Email is suitable for short questions (to answers that cannot be found in the syllabus), to set up appointments, or to notify me about being late or absent. Emails should not be longer than 5 sentences.

For matters longer than 5 sentences, please email me to make an appointment during office hours. This is the proper way to address longer questions, issues, to ask me about an assignment, review a grade you received, or to discuss other matters. If you send me a long email, I am simply going to respond by asking you to meet with me to resolve the matter. I will not resolve matters over email.
